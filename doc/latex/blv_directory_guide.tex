The Bluevia Directory API is a set of functions which allows users to retrieve user-\/related information, divided in four blocks (user profile, access information, personal information and terminal information). This guide represents a practical introduction to developing applications in which the user wants to provide the Bluevia Directory functionality.\hypertarget{blv_directory_guide_directory_client_basics_sec}{}\subsection{Directory client basics}\label{blv_directory_guide_directory_client_basics_sec}
A Directory client represents the client side in a classic client-\/server schema. This object wraps up the underlying REST client side functionality needed to perform requests against a REST server.

Any Bluevia client performs requests and receives responses in a secure mode. Clients are authorized following the OAuth protocol. This security protocol enables users to grant third-\/party access to their resources without sharing their passwords. So clients store the authorization data -\/called security credentials-\/ to grant access to the server. Following sections describe the security credentials we are talking about.\hypertarget{blv_directory_guide_creating_directory_client_sec}{}\subsection{Creating a Directory client: BVDirectory class}\label{blv_directory_guide_creating_directory_client_sec}
The first step in using the Directory client is to create an BVDirectory object. As we mentioned earlier this object could have three different working modes: i) as a client which sends requests to a real server, ii) a client working with a real server in testing mode, or iii) as a client which sends requests and receives responses to/from a sandbox server.\hypertarget{blv_directory_guide_directoryclient_features_working_modes_sec}{}\subsubsection{DirectoryClient features: working modes}\label{blv_directory_guide_directoryclient_features_working_modes_sec}
When you create the client, you can specify various working modes: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item BVBaseClient.Mode.LIVE \par
In the Live environment your application uses the real network, which means that you will be able to send real transactions to real Movistar, O2 and Vivo customers in the applicable country.


\item BVBaseClient.Mode.TEST \par
The Test mode behave exactly like the Live mode, but the API calls are free of chargue, using a credits system. You are required to have a Movistar, O2 or Vivo mobile number to get this monthly credits.


\item BVBaseClient.Mode.SANDBOX \par
The Sandbox environment offers you the exact same experience as the Live environment except that no traffic is generated on the live network, meaning you can experiment and play until your heartâ€™s content. 
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{blv_directory_guide_directoryclient_features_security_credentials}{}\subsubsection{Directory client features: security credentials}\label{blv_directory_guide_directoryclient_features_security_credentials}
Bluevia uses OAuth as its authentication mechanism which enables websites and applications to access the Bluevia API's without end users disclosing their personal credentials. In order to grant access to the server any client has to be created passing the security credential as parameter in its constructor. These security credentials are managed internally and added as a HTTP header in every request sent to the server. Such Oauth security credentials are: 
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Consumer key} \par
The string identifying the application-\/ you obtained when you registered your application within the provisioning portal.


\item {\bfseries Consumer secret} \par
A secret -\/a string-\/ used by the consumer to establish ownership of the consumer key.


\item {\bfseries Access token} \par
The token -\/a string-\/ used by the client for granting access permissions to the server.


\item {\bfseries Access token secret} \par
The secret of the access token. 
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{blv_directory_guide_directoryclient_features_code_example}{}\subsubsection{Directory client features: code example}\label{blv_directory_guide_directoryclient_features_code_example}
Find below an example on how to create an BVDirectory object taking into account all information previously given.


\begin{DoxyCode}
// Mode.LIVE indicating the client works against a real Bluevia server.
try {
        BVDirectory directoryClient = new BVDirectory(Mode.LIVE, "consumer_key", 
      "consumer_secret", "access_token", "access_token_secret");
} catch (BlueviaException e){
        log.error(e.getMessage());
}
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{blv_directory_guide_directoryclient_features_freeing_resources_sec}{}\subsubsection{DirectoryClient features: freeing resources}\label{blv_directory_guide_directoryclient_features_freeing_resources_sec}
It is very important to free the resources that the client instantiates to work. To do this call the close method after finishing using the client:


\begin{DoxyCode}
directoryClient.close();
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{blv_directory_guide_retrieving_user_info_sec}{}\subsection{Retrieving User Info}\label{blv_directory_guide_retrieving_user_info_sec}
This method retrieves the whole user info resource block from the directory. User profile includes user profile, access, personal and terminal info blocks. The signature of the method is:


\begin{DoxyCode}
UserInfo getUserInfo() throws BlueviaException, IOException
\end{DoxyCode}


Check the API Reference to see the information that can be obtained from the UserProfile returned object, accessible using getter methods.\hypertarget{blv_directory_guide_retrieving_user_info_using_filters_sec}{}\subsubsection{Selecting blocks in requests}\label{blv_directory_guide_retrieving_user_info_using_filters_sec}
In case the user doesn't want to retrieve all blocks, there is an option to retrieve only a subset of the available information, using filters. An array of UserInfo.DataSet can be included in the request selecting the desired info blocks:


\begin{DoxyCode}
UserInfo getUserInfo(UserInfo.DataSet[] dataSet) throws BlueviaException, IOExcep
      tion
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{blv_directory_guide_user_info_code_example_sec}{}\subsubsection{Code examples}\label{blv_directory_guide_user_info_code_example_sec}
This is a example for retrieving the whole user info block:


\begin{DoxyCode}
try {
        //Get the UserInfo response
        UserInfo info = directoryClient.getUserInfo();

        Profile profile = info.getProfile();
        AccessInfo accessInfo = info.getAccessInfo();
        PersonalInfo personalInfo = info.getPersonalInfo();
        TerminalInfo terminalInfo = info.getTerminalInfo();     
        
        /* Get information and do stuff */
          
} catch (BlueviaException e) {
        log.error("Error getting user info", e);
} catch (IOException e) {
        log.error("Error getting user info", e);
}
\end{DoxyCode}


For filtering blocks, you have to include the data sets you want to retrieve. This is an example:


\begin{DoxyCode}
try {
        //Select data sets
        UserInfo.DataSet[] dataSet = {DataSet.ACCESS_INFO, DataSet.PERSONAL_INFO}
      ;
        
        //Get the UserInfo response
        UserInfo info = directoryClient.getUserInfo(dataSet);

        AccessInfo accessInfo = info.getAccessInfo();
        TerminalInfo terminalInfo = info.getTerminalInfo();     
        
        /* Get information and do stuff */
          
} catch (BlueviaException e) {
        log.error("Error getting user info", e);
} catch (IOException e) {
        log.error("Error getting user info", e);
}
\end{DoxyCode}

        log.error("Error getting user profile", e);
} catch (IOException e) {
        log.error("Error getting user profile", e);
}
\end{DoxyCode}


For filtering information, you have to include the fields you want to retrieve. This is an example:
