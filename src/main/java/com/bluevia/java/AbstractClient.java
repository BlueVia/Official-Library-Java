	 * You are required to have a Movistar, O2 or Vivo mobile number to get this monthly credits.
	 * 
	 * - Sandbox: The Sandbox environment offers you the exact same experience as the Live environment except 
	 * that no traffic is generated on the live network, meaning you can experiment and play until your heartâ€™s content.
